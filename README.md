# elm-webpack-starter

## Pre-requisites

Have node, npm and [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) installed

## Running the app

* Enter the command `npm start` in the project directory
* Visit your browser at `http://localhost:8080/`

## Debugging

If you get error(which I got) with `node-sass` rebuild it using `npm rebuild node-sass`
